# Setup & Configuration

## Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `C# >= .NET 6`

## Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `nuget`:

```bash
dotnet add package PostmanClient
```

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

The postman_client API uses API keys as a form of authentication. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or a program that is calling the API.

#### Setting the API key

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the API key as follows:

```cs
using PostmanClient;
using PostmanClient.Config;

var config = new PostmanClientConfig()
{
	ApiKeyAuth = new ApiKeyAuthConfig("YOUR_API_KEY")
};

var client = new PostmanClientClient(config);
```

If you need to set or update the API key after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```cs
client.SetApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```cs
using PostmanClient;
using PostmanClient.Config;
using Environment = PostmanClient.Http.Environment;

var apiKeyConfig = new ApiKeyAuthConfig("YOUR_API_KEY");

var config = new PostmanClientConfig
{
  Environment = Environment.Default,
ApiKeyAuth = apiKeyConfig
};

var client = new PostmanClientClient(config);

var response = await client.Billing.GetAccountsAsync();

Console.WriteLine(response);

```
